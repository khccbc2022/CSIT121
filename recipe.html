        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Gulab Jamun is a highly delicious, milk-based sweet coming directly from the Indian subcontinent. The main ingredients here are milk solids (there are other things as well, though). They traditionally come from Khoya and they are basically a “soft dough” version of regular milk.
